<h2>Exporting a Movie</h2>

If you choose the menu command "File &gt; Export quickly..." in order to export your movie, you will just be asked for the folder and name of the file you wish to create.
The menu command "File &gt; Export..." has additional options which will be discussed in this document.

A dialog will appear asking you to specify a name and location for the newly created file. The extension ".mov" will be appended, unless you supply a different one.

<p>
Next, a sheet will appear asking you which codec should be used for exporting the movie. A codec is the software component that is responsible for compressing the stream of movie data. Different codecs have their own advantages and disadvantages concerning size and quality of the resulting movie. The default choice Apple's <em>H.264</em> codec which provides both small movie files and very good picture quality. You can't go wrong with this one; if you're an expert you may of course choose a different one. The list contains every codec on your Mac that is registered with QuickTime, but be warned: Some codecs (like <em>BMP</em>) may have disastrous results (great quality, but taking gigabytes of hard disk space for movies lasting only thirty seconds). Do some research before trying a new codec.
<p>
In addition, you may choose from three quality settings: <em>high, normal</em> or <em>low</em>. Less quality usually results in smaller movie files, which in turn contain more artifacts. When using <em>H.264</em>, you can in most cases rely on the <em>normal</em> quality setting. The <em>high</em> setting has only marginally better quality.

After you have selected a codec and quality, the actual encoding will start. You will see a progress bar indicating the remaining time. When the progress sheet closes, your new QuickTime movie file exists at the location you specified.
