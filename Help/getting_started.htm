<h2>Getting started with FrameByFrame</h2>
So you've downloaded FrameByFrame - where do you go from here? This guide will help you get your feet wet.

<h4>Connect a camera to your Mac</h4>
FrameByFrame can use any kind of webcam or other video input device your Mac supports (still image cameras are not supported). Connect a camera via USB or FireWire; if you are going to use your built-in iSight, sit back and do nothing until the next step!

<h4>Create a new movie</h4>
<p>You will need an empty movie document to hold the pictures you take. To create one, use the Organizer. If the Organizer window isn't visible, choose <i>File &gt; New</i>, or press &#8984;-N. Click the <i>New movie</i> tab, select one of the predefined movie resolutions (or enter your own), and press <i>Create movie</i>.
<p>The movie window for your newly created movie will show up, and video feed will start playing after a few seconds. If no video feed appears, or if you want to change the input device, switch to the <i>Input</i> tab and select the camera you want from the box labelled <i>Input device</i>. If the camera you want to use is not listed, visit the <a href="http://webcam-osx.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">macam project</a> which provides drivers for a wide array of third-party cameras.
</p>

<h4>Take some pictures</h4>
<p>It's finally time to take your first picture. Point your camera at something interesting, and click the shutter button. Snap! A new picture has been added to your movie reel. Keep taking pictures, changing your scene bit by bit.

<p>Next, add several pictures to your document by clicking the camera button in the lower right corner of the window or by pressing &#8984;-. (that is, Command-Period). You can also use a custom shortcut assigned in the Preferences or the <i>play</i> button on your Apple Remote.<br>
<center><table><td align=center><img src="../Capture_Capture_Off.tiff"><tr><td align=center>The camera button</table></center><br>
<p>The pictures will be added to the picture strip below the video output view along with timing information.
<p>
</p>
-->

<h4>Save or export your movie</h4>
<p>Now that you have created an interesting sequence of pictures, you'll want to save your work, so that you can re-open it later and continue working. Use <i>File &gt; Save as...</i> or press &#8984;-&#8679;-S to save your movie document as a FrameByFrame file. You can open it later with FrameByFrame.
	</p>
<p>If you'd rather create a QuickTime movie that can be played by any movie player, use <i>File &gt; Export movie...</i>. It's as simple as that.
