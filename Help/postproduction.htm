<h2>Post-Production</h2>

Using video editing applications like iMovie allows you to apply special effects and transformations to your exported QuickTime movie. But what if you want to use effects and filters only available to image editing applications like <i>Adobe Photoshop</i><small><sup>&reg;</sup></small> or <i>Gimp</i><small><sup>TM</sup></small>? What if you'd like to edit some frames of your movie by hand?<br>
The way FrameByFrame saves movie documents allows you to do all of that. Here's how.

<h4>Create and save a document</h4>
<p>
Create your movie document as you normally would. Then save it to disk, close FrameByFrame and select its file in a Finder window.
</p>

<h4>Reveal the document's contents</h4>
<p>
Control-click the file (or right-click it, you Mighty Mousers) and choose "Show package contents" from the context menu. A new window will open, containing a lot of files. These are the images your document contains. They are actually just image files in the TIFF format without filename extension. You can open them normally, e.g. using your Mac's Preview application.
</p>

<h4>Edit the document's images</h4>
<p>
You can now use any image editor to alter those files in any way you like. <i>Photoshop</i>, <i>Gimp</i> and many other applications even come with a so-called <em>batch processing</em> feature, which allows you to edit any number of files at once. For example, you may want apply a filter to all of your images to make them look like oil paintings, or to add motion blur, etc.
</p>

<h4>Continue working with your document</h4>
<p>
Once all changes have been made and saved, re-open your document in FrameByFrame. You may now export your movie and obtain a regular QuickTime movie containing all the glorious effects modern image editors have to offer.
