<h2>Drag and Drop Support</h2>

FrameByFrame offers you the possibility to use the mouse in order to edit your movie documents.
<p>
 
<h4>Dragging pictures within a movie document</h4>
If you want to change the position of one or more pictures in your movie, there's an easy way to do it using the mouse. Just select a picture by clicking on it (or several pictures by holding &#8984; and clicking on them) and start dragging it by moving the mouse while the button is pressed. An insertion mark will show and move along with the mouse pointer (see image below). The image strip will start scrolling when you move the pointer near its left or right borders, allowing you to drag the picture farther to the right.<br>

The pictures will be removed from their original positions and inserted at the desired position.

<h4>Dragging pictures between documents</h4>
You may drag pictures starting in one FrameByFrame document and releasing them in another document. In this case, the pictures will not be removed from the document of origin. If you need to remove them, you can do so after the drag and drop operation by pressing the Cut button.<br>
<em>Hint:</em> If the target document is obscured by other windows, so that you can't complete the dragging, use Expos&eacute; to do the trick: While dragging your pictures, press <b>F10</b> to bring up all FrameByFrame documents, then select the one you need by hovering the pointer over it and proceed as usual. 

<h4>Dragging image files from other sources</h4>
Any source of image files (most commonly a Finder window) may be used to drag pictures into a FrameByFrame document. For example: Select one or more image files from your hard disk in a Finder window and drag them onto the image strip of a FrameByFrame document. Once you release them, they will be inserted into the document.<br>
FrameByFrame recognizes all image file formats that are supported by the Cocoa library. The best-known of these are JPEG, TIFF and PNG.

<h4>Dragging pictures into the Finder or other destinations</h4>
Any application that accepts image files may be the target of a dragging operation started in FrameByFrame.
E.g., drag some of your document's pictures into your Documents folder, and they will be saved there as TIFF files. The file names will be numbered <em>FF00001.tiff</em> through <em>FF&lt;number of pictures dragged&gt;.tiff</em>.
